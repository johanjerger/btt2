# btt2

**btt2** is a C game developed for _documentation_ and _good practice techniques_ purposes. The first release of btt can be downloaded [here][1], this release have a more procedural and not scalable way of thinking, but btt2 wants to apply all the **C language** power for make a great _scalable_, _readable_ and _ready to change_ game. [Install It!][2]

### New Features
---

* **_Linked-lists_** to perform data representation in a more _cleaning_ and _performance_ way. 

* **_Hashmaps_** to avoid _switch_ structures.

* **_Component oriented_** like programming mixing _structs_ and _function pointers_.

* **_Anti-if_** way of thinking. (know more [here][3])

### Documentation purposes
---

Like I say, this game attends to be a beauty way to learn good practices, not only for the C language, avoid conditional structures, comment everything you can and think every codeline twice are good practices for all the languages and code developers.

This game attends to has a strong standard, maintain a really nice [change-log][4] and perform a serious project in every state.
